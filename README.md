# Bash it for Q

A hacked version of bash-it so it runs headless from a single (long) command.

Thanks to the orginal: [Bash-It](https://github.com/revans/bash-it)


## Run this command to install
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/qcook2000/bash-it/master/silent-install.sh) && source ~/.bash_profile
```
