# Bash it for Q

A hacked version of bash-it so it runs headless from a single (long) command.

Thanks to the orginal: [Bash-It](https://github.com/revans/bash-it)


## Run this command to install
```
if [ ! -d ~/.bash_it ]; then cd && git clone https://github.com/qcook2000/bash-it.git .bash_it; fi; sh ~/.bash_it/install.sh && source ~/.bash_profile
```
